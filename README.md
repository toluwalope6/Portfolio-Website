Tolu's Portfolio Website

This personal portfolio website I built to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and to showcase my projects, technical skills, and proffesional experience as a Computer Science & Software Engineering student at Maynooth University.

Deployed live at ðŸ‘‰ portfolio-website-flax-two-65.vercel.app
